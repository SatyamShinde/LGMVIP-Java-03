_**Scientific Calculator**_

A scientific calculator is like a super-smart version of a regular calculator. It can do all the basic math stuff like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, but it can also handle more advanced math problems.

These calculators have lots of buttons for different functions, like "sin" and "cos" for trigonometry, and "log" for finding out the power you need to raise a certain number to get another number.

They're super handy for students, scientists, engineers, and anyone who deals with more complex math problems. So, you can think of a scientific calculator as a super helper for all sorts of math challenges!

**THANK-YOU !!**
